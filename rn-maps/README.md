# React-native-Logging-Template

This is a mobile template of sign in and sign up

To run that

1. clone and run yarn install or npm install
2. expo start || npm start || yarn start

this is the V2 template of sign in and sign up, in this template, it is configured and connected to the express-signIn-server(https://github.com/simonlyllyyy92/Express-Signin-server) which has been successfully deployed to heroku.

in this template, we used react redux, redux saga to make api request call and store the response token into reducer, the base URL has been set in config.js file in api folder.

Besides this also can be another redux and saga configuration template for future reference
the navigationService.js file could be a good example for how to access navigation props outside of the mainflow.

The next version of this template will be added new pages and Loading Icon and other upgrades.
