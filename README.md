# React-native-Logging-Template

This is a mobile template of sign in and sign up

To run that

1. clone and run yarn install or npm install
2. expo start || npm start || yarn start

this is the V3 template of sign in and sign up which is the final version

in this version, first we add sign up and sign in failed action to avoid loading icon keep showing when action failed

second, we clear up the input value every time we attempt to sign in or sign up

third, we created an user info screen, after sign in successfully, it will navigate to userinfo screen.
